Blowyourfaceoff canvas checklist test

The purpose of this test is to ensure that the drawing canvas is working correctly.

1) Go to this page on your device: http://blowyourfaceoff.com/gameplay.php?gid=776027&round=1&name=test
  You can use this link over and over. If you clicked Submit, just hit refresh to reload the page and test again.

2) Check the following things:
  - Can you draw at all? When you drag your finger/mouse/pen, does it draw lines successfully?
  - When you pick up your finger/pen/release mouse button, does it stop drawing?
  - Does it make any unexpected stray lines? If so, can you determine under what specific circumstances?
  - The page should not attempt to scroll while you are drawing. Does it scroll while you're interacting with the canvas?
  - Can you make dots? Select the largest line width (because it's easiest to see) and tap once on the canvas without dragging. Did it make a dot?
  - How is the drawing experience overall? Any problems not described above?
